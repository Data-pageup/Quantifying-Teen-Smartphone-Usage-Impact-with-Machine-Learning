# 📱 Teen Smartphone Usage & Addiction Impact – ML Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores how **smartphone usage patterns** affect teenagers’ academic, health, and behavioral outcomes.  
Using **machine learning**, we quantify the impact of screen time, social media, gaming, and lifestyle factors on:  

- 📖 **Academic performance**  
- 🧠 **Cognitive skills** (IQ, grades, projects)  
- ⚖️ **Lifestyle balance** (exercise, phone checks, etc.)  
- 🎯 **Placement readiness**
