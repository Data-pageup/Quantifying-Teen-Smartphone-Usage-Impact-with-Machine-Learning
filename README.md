📱 Teen Smartphone Usage & Addiction Impact – ML Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project explores how smartphone usage patterns affect teenagers’ academic, health, and behavioral outcomes.
Using machine learning, we quantify the impact of screen time, social media, gaming, and lifestyle factors on:

📖 Academic performance

🧠 Cognitive skills (IQ, grades, projects)

⚖️ Lifestyle balance (exercise, phone checks, etc.)

🎯 Placement readiness

🗂️ Dataset Highlights

The dataset captures detailed daily/weekly usage behavior of teenagers:

Gender	Gender identity
Time_on_Social_Media	Daily hours on social media
Time_on_Education	Daily study/learning hours
Time_on_Gaming	Daily gaming hours
Phone_Checks_Per_Day	No. of times phone checked daily
Phone_Usage_Purpose	Primary purpose (social, education, gaming, etc.)
Exercise_Hours	Weekly physical activity (hours)
Academic_Performance	GPA or academic score
IQ	Self-reported / estimated intelligence
CG	Cumulative Grade
Internship_Experience	Internship exposure (Yes/No)
Projects_Completed	Academic / personal projects completed
Placement	Placement status (Selected/Not Selected)

🎯 Research & Use Cases

This dataset + analysis can be used to:

🔍 Analytics → Explore correlations between digital habits & outcomes

📊 Regression Models → Predict addiction impact score or academic performance

🏷️ Classification Models → Categorize teens into Low / Moderate / High Addiction

🧑‍🏫 Education Insights → Understand how smartphone usage influences learning & placements

⚙️ Machine Learning Models

We implemented and compared multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

📈 Models were evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² scores with visualization for performance comparison.
